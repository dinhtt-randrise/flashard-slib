Lucene is widely used as a standard foundation for production search applications. Lucene has been ported to other programming languages including Object Pascal, Perl, C#, C++, Python, Ruby and PHP. [ History ]\n\nDoug Cutting originally wrote Lucene in 1999. Lucene was his fifth search engine. The name Lucene is Doug Cutting's wife's middle name and her maternal grandmother's first name. Lucene formerly included a number of sub-projects, such as Lucene.NET, Mahout, Tika and Nutch. In March 2010, the Apache Solr search server joined as a Lucene sub-project, merging the developer communities. In March 2021, Lucene changed its logo, and Apache Solr became a top level Apache project again, independent from Lucene. [ Features and common use ]\n\nWhile suitable for any application that requires full text indexing and searching capability, Lucene is recognized for its utility in the implementation of Internet search engines and local, single-site searching. Lucene includes a feature to perform a fuzzy search based on edit distance. Lucene has also been used to implement recommendation systems. For example, Lucene's 'MoreLikeThis' Class can generate recommendations for similar documents. In a comparison of the term vector-based similarity approach of 'MoreLikeThis' with citation-based document similarity measures, such as co-citation and co-citation proximity analysis, Lucene's approach excelled at recommending documents with very similar structural characteristics and more narrow relatedness.
